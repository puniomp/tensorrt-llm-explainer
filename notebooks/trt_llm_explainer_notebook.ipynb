    "LLM inference is usually split into two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefill (context ingestion)**: process the full input sequence once.\n",
    "- **Decode (token generation)**: generate tokens one-by-one while reusing a **KV cache**.\n",

    "### 1.1 Prefill Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long sequence length (e.g., 1K–8K tokens).\n",
    "- Large matrix multiplications (GEMMs) dominate.\n",
    "- GPU can reach high Tensor Core utilization.\n",
    "- Often **compute-bound**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Decode Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "- We generate **one token per step per sequence**.\n",
    "- Each new token has to attend over all previous tokens using the KV cache.\n",
    "- Much smaller effective batch size at each step.\n",
    "- Often **memory-bound** because we keep re-reading the KV cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means **prefill and decode have different bottlenecks**, which matters when thinking about why TRT-LLM is faster.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Graph-level optimization**  \n",
    "   - Capture the LLM graph.\n",
    "   - Fuse compatible ops into bigger kernels.\n",

    "   - Greatly reduce memory round-trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficient KV cache management (paged KV cache)**  \n",
    "   - Avoid large, contiguous allocations that fragment memory.\n",
    "   - Use block-based layouts that scale better with sequence length and batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic batching and scheduling**  \n",
    "   - Batch tokens across multiple sequences at runtime.\n",
    "   - Maximize throughput without blowing up latency.\n",

    "## 4. KV Cache and Paged Attention (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "During decode, we reuse the previously computed key/value tensors (K, V) so that generating token *t* does **not** require recomputing attention against all tokens *< t*. These cached tensors form the **KV cache**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Naive KV Cache Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "In a naive implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each sequence allocates one large contiguous KV buffer\n",
    "- As sequence grow at different rates, memory becomes fragmented.\n",
    "- If the buffer needs to grow, frameworks may need to 'realloc' or copy large amounts of memory.\n",
    "- This becomes expensive when serving many concurrent sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This layout is simple but does not scale well for real-time multi-user serving workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Paged KV Cache (High Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "Paged KV cache avoids these problems by splitting the KV memory into **fixed-size blocks (\"pages\")**, typically 16-128 tokens each.\n",
    "\n",
    "A small **indirection table** maps logical sequence positions -> physical memory blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No large reallocations:** Growing a sequence only means attaching another page, not resizing a giant buffer.\n",
    "- **Memory reuse:** Freed pages can be recycled for other sequences.\n",
    "- **Reduced fragmentation:** The system only manages uniform blocks.\n",
    "- **Efficient batching:** Pages align sequences so that multiple sequences can be processed together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Paged KV cache is one of the key enablers behind high-throughput serving systems like vLLM and TensorRT-LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Clarification: Paged Attention Does *Not* Reduce Compute\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with paging, attention still computes against **all previous tokens**.\n",
    "Splitting K/V into blocks changes **how we access memory**, but it does *not*\n",
    "change the algorithmic cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the simulated paged-attention NumPy cell has latency numbers nearly\n",
    "identical to the full-attention version—the computation is the same, only the\n",
    "memory layout is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "On real GPUs, however, the paged layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves memory locality,\n",
    "- Enables kernel fusion,\n",
    "- Reduces overhead under high concurrency,\n",

    "### What this cost model shows\n",
    "\n",
    "This toy example illustrates a simple but important point: if a model produces more tokens per second, it directly reduces the cost of serving tokens. The cost per million tokens is proportional to the number of GPU-hours needed. If TensorRT-LLM delivers 3x higher throughput than PyTorch (1500 vs 500 tokens/sec in this example), then the GPU spends 3x less time generating the same number of tokens. Since GPU pricing is based on time, the cost per million tokens drop by roughly the same factor.\n",

    "- *\"Paged KV cache and dynamic batching are crucial for high-concurrency LLM serving because they keep memory usage predictable and avoid fragmentation.\"*\n",
